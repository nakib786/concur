# Email Confirmation Setup Guide

## Overview
The application now properly handles email confirmation for user signups. Users will receive a confirmation email and be redirected through a proper flow instead of going to localhost.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Auth Callback Route (`/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles the redirect from Supabase email confirmation links
- **Function**: Exchanges the confirmation code for a user session
- **Profile Creation**: Automatically creates user profile if it doesn't exist
- **Redirect**: Sends users to a confirmation success page

### 2. Email Confirmation Page (`/auth/confirmed/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Shows users a success message after email confirmation
- **Features**: 
  - Loading state while verifying authentication
  - Success message with automatic redirect to dashboard
  - Error handling for failed confirmations
  - Manual "Continue" button as backup

### 3. Updated Signup Flow (`/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
- **Email Redirect**: Now sets `emailRedirectTo` to point to `/auth/callback`
- **Confirmation Detection**: Detects when email confirmation is required
- **Success Message**: Shows users a message to check their email
- **Improved UX**: Clear feedback about what happens next

## Required Supabase Configuration

### 1. Site URL Settings
In your Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication > URL Configuration**
2. Set **Site URL** to your domain:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com`

### 2. Redirect URLs
Add these redirect URLs in **Authentication > URL Configuration**:
- Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`

### 3. Email Confirmation Settings
In **Authentication > Settings**:
- ✅ **Enable email confirmations** (if desired)
- Set **Email confirmation redirect URL** to: `[YOUR_DOMAIN]/auth/callback`

## Email Flow Process

### 1. User Signs Up
```
User fills signup form → Supabase sends confirmation email
```

### 2. Email Confirmation
```
User clicks email link → Redirected to /auth/callback → Profile created → Success page
```

### 3. Final Redirect
```
Success page → Automatic redirect to dashboard after 2 seconds
```

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Development Testing
1. Start your development server
2. Go to signup page
3. Create account with real email address
4. Check email for confirmation link
5. Click link - should redirect to confirmation success page
6. Should automatically redirect to dashboard

### 2. Production Testing
1. Deploy with proper environment variables
2. Configure Supabase URLs correctly
3. Test with real email address
4. Verify entire flow works end-to-end

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still redirecting to localhost
**Solution**: Check Supabase URL configuration
- Verify Site URL is set correctly
- Ensure redirect URLs include your domain
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Email confirmation not working
**Solution**: Check email settings
- Verify email confirmation is enabled in Supabase
- Check spam folder for confirmation emails
- Ensure SMTP settings are configured

### Issue: Profile not created after confirmation
**Solution**: Check callback route
- Verify `/auth/callback/route.ts` exists
- Check console logs for errors
- Ensure service role key is configured

### Issue: Redirect loops or errors
**Solution**: Check authentication state
- Clear browser storage/cookies
- Check for multiple auth sessions
- Verify environment variables are correct

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your deployment:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```
